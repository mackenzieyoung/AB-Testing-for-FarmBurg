## Term definitions:
**Linked Lists** are a data structure in which each element points to the next. Each element of a linked list contains two items â€“ a value (for example, an integer) and a pointer to the next element. Elements can be inserted or removed from any position in the lsit.

**Stacks** are a data structure in which elements can either be pushed or popped. When an element is pushed, it is added to the top of the stack, and when it is popped, it is removed from the top of the stack. Unlike a linked list, elements can only be added or removed from the top of the stack.

**Hash Maps** are a data structure in which each element maps a key to a value. Similar to a dictionary, a value can be looked up given a key. Unlike linked lists and stacks, the elements in hash tables are not ordered in any particular way.

**Trees** are a data structure in which elements are heirarchically organized nodes. At the top of the tree is the root node, which branches off into daughter nodes, which branch off into their own daughter nodes, and so on. The node that a daughter node branches off from is called the parent node. Nodes can only be connected to their parent and daughter nodes; no nodes on the same level of the hierarchy are directly connected to each other.

**Heaps** are a kind of tree data structure in which the daughter nodes are always less than or equal to (or greater than or equal to) their parent node.
